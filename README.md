# Getting Started

## Using poetry

1. Install poetry. Using apt:
```
apt install python3-poetry
```

2. Go to this repository and install the repository.
```
poetry install
```

3. Open a poetry shell (env) and give it a try.
```
poetry shell
python hand_manipulation/main_allegro.py
# python hand_manipulation/main_shadow.py
```
## Docker

There was a docker installation with ROS2. The docker file is still provided but no necessary to make the hand work
since we are not using ROS in our case.
